  text: "I love illustration, and as art requires practice and dedication, it's supposed I have to draw kind of regularly in order to maintain and improve the quality of my work. The problem is that, as I always have \"something else to do\", at the end of the day I don't make any art work at all.\n\nThat's why I've  created this website: to keep myself drawing, at least from time to time, and to have some space to show my work (after all, this way is better than showing unfinished drafts made on napkins during moments of inspiration).\n\nIf you like this content, don't forget to follow me on my social networks (or, if you are old fashioned, subscribe to my RSS/Atom/JSON channel), and share it with your friends :)",
